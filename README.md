## Projects

### Project 1: Penetration Testing Lab

**Overview**:  
In this project, I created a controlled penetration testing environment to practice vulnerability assessments, exploitation, and ethical hacking techniques.

**Technologies Used**:
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite

**Objectives**:
- Perform vulnerability assessments using Nmap.
- Exploit vulnerabilities with Metasploit.
- Understand common attack vectors and prevention mechanisms.

**Results**:  
- Discovered open ports and vulnerabilities on the target machine.
- Successfully exploited a known vulnerability using Metasploit.

### Project 2: Network Security Configuration

**Overview**:  
This project involves setting up a secure network environment with firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and network segmentation.

**Technologies Used**:
- pfSense
- Snort
- Wireshark

**Objectives**:
- Configure pfSense as a firewall to secure network traffic.
- Set up Snort IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Implement network segmentation for enhanced security.

**Results**:  
- Successfully blocked unauthorized access and monitored traffic for potential threats.
- Demonstrated secure network configuration with practical use of IDS.

### Project 3: Incident Response and Monitoring

**Overview**:  
In this project, I set up a SIEM system to monitor network activities, detect potential threats, and respond to simulated security incidents.

**Technologies Used**:
- Splunk
- Python (for scripting)

**Objectives**:
- Set up Splunk for real-time log analysis.
- Create alerts for detecting suspicious activities.
- Simulate and respond to a security incident.

**Results**:  
- Detected and responded to a brute-force attack using real-time Splunk alerts.
- Analyzed logs to identify attack patterns and prevent future incidents.
